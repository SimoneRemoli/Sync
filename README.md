### :lotus_position_man: The semaphore structure is particularly useful for managing synchronization tasks between processes and threads.

### :nerd_face: Using System V technology.

Semaphores enable processes to query or alter status information. They are often used to monitor and control the availability of system resources such as shared memory segments. Semaphores can be operated on as individual units or as elements in a set. The semaphore set must be initialized using semget. The semaphore creator can change its ownership or permissions using semctl. Any process with permission can use semctl to do control operations.
Semaphore operations are performed by semop. This interface takes a pointer to an array of semaphore operation structures. Each structure in the array contains data about an operation to perform on a semaphore. Any process with read permission can test whether a semaphore has a zero value. Operations to increment or decrement a semaphore require write permission. 
Only one process at a time can update a semaphore. Simultaneous requests by different processes are performed in an arbitrary order. When an array of operations is given by a semop call, no updates are done until all operations on the array can finish successfully.
